# Circle
 CSS 340 Program 1: Intro Class Design
 Instructions:
     Purpose:
         This programming assignment will introduce the Python language to the student. A simple class
         is designed and coded. The purpose is to start coding something quick in Python and also
         design a simple class using the proper coding style guidelines.
         
         The Circle
         Design a class which represents a Circle in the (x,y) coordinate plane. A Circle object is
         initialized with three input arguments. The center of the circle specified as the first two inputs
         (x,y) and the radius of the circle. By default the circle will be centered at (0, 0) with a radius of
         1.
             c = Circle(0, 0, 1)
         
         The Circle class should provide proper getters/setters for the x and y coordinates of the center
         as well as the radius. The circle should also have a getArea() and getPerimeter() method.
         Finally, the circle should have a method called, isPointWithinCircle(x, y) which takes as
         augments the x and y coordinate of a point and determines whether the point lies within the
         circle. It should return a boolean indicating whether the point is within the circle.
